## Custom styles

Some custom styles can be applied using fenced div or direct inline styling: [This text will be blue]{custom-style="Blue"}.

Example of a **quote**:

::: {custom-style="Quote"}

"It is further proof that refugee movements and the broader issue of migration of populations ... is a global challenge that cannot be confined to a few countries."

:::

**Filippo Grandi**

Footnotes are also included and will be added automatically to the bottom of the page like the following ones. This is a footnote^[Text of the footnote], it can include anything and can also be stylize UNHCR^[The **United Nations** High Commissioner for Refugees <https://www.unhcr.org/>]

Example of **list**:

Lists also are automatic but they will need extra manual tweaking if you want to apply a more adapted paragraph style with less spacing. This apply for both ordered and unordered lists.

* item 1
* item 2
* item 3

## Tables

Tables will come with a default style. More advanced layout can be achieved using the [flextable](https://ardata-fr.github.io/flextable-book/index.html) package. Like the lists there is a built-in paragraph style if you want to improve the look and feel of your tables.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, tab.cap="Example of an Iris table"}
tail(iris, 8)
```
