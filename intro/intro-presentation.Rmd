## What is the difference between R and R Studio?
:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
* To use R, we will need to download two first download R (Base R) and RStudio.
  + Base R is the basic software which contains the R programming language and packages that were created by original R authors. It does not come with a graphical interface by default.
  + RStudio is a full "Integrated Development Environment" (IDE), i.e., the software the makes R programming easier. We will use it as a place where we can keep scripts, plots and R outputs together in one single place.
  
  
* Open source and free

## RStudio panes
1. Source
  + Where you write your code, which will be "Run" to the console.
2. Console
  + Where your code is evaluated by R
3. Environment / History
4. Files / Plots / Packages / Help
